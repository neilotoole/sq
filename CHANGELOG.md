## [v0.20.0] - 2022-12-29

### Added

- `sq` now generates manpages (and installs them). 

## [v0.19.0] - 2022-12-29

### Added

- Installer for [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org), 
  via [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org). 

## [v0.18.2] - 2022-12-25

### Added

- The build pipeline now produces `.apk` packages for [Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org),
  and `install.sh` has been updated accordingly. However, the `.apk` files
  are not yet published to a repository, so it's necessary to run `apk` against
  the downloaded `.apk` file (`install.sh` does this for you).


## [v0.18.0] - 2022-12-24

### Added

- [#95]: `sq add` now has a `--password` (`-p`) flag that prompts the user for the data source
  password, instead of putting it in the location string. It will also read from stdin
  if there's input there.

## [v0.17.0] - 2022-12-23

### Changed

- More or less every `go.mod` dependency has been updated to latest. This includes
  drivers for `sqlite` and `sqlserver`. The driver updates led to some broken
  things, which have been fixed.

## [v0.16.1] - 2022-12-23

### Fixed

- [#123]: Shell completion is better behaved when a source is offline.

## [v0.16.0] - 2022-12-16

### Added

- `--verbose` flag is now global
- `install.sh` install script.

### Changed

- Improved GH workflow
- `sq inspect` shows less output by default (use `-v` to restore previous behavior)

### Fixed

- `sq inspect` can now deal with Postgres sources that have null values for constraint fields

## [v0.15.11] - 2022-11-06

### Changed
