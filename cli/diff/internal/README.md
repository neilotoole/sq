This `internal` package contains a fork of https://github.com/aymanbagabas/go-udiff,
to allow additional customization. Specifically, we need to show
a configurable number of surrounding lines. An 
[issue](https://github.com/aymanbagabas/go-udiff/issues/5) has been opened.

Note that the `aymanbagabas` package is itself a copy of
the Go tools internal [diff](https://github.com/golang/tools/tree/master/internal/diff) package.
